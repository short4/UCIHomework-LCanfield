VBA Challenge Homework 

The file StockChecker.vbs is VBA script written in Visual Studio Code to run through a list of individual stock tickers for every day in a year. The code creates a summary table for each individual stock ticker and summarizes the data as follows: 

  <ticker> - is the stock ticker symbol 
  <yearly_change>  - the difference between the open price on day 1 and the close price on the last day
  <percent_change> - the percent change the occured from the open on day 1 to the close price on the last day 
  <volume> - the total volume of trading for that ticker symbol during the year
  
A more advanced challenge was to have the code repeat through each worksheet in the workbook. I attempted this but was unable to get it to work properly and have deleted this code. 

This script is meant to be used with the file Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm

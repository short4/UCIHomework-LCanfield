For the first part of the assignment (Weather) I analyzed cities across the globe for factors such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed to look at the correlation of 
these factors when compared to Latitude. The cities were chosen at random and the original dataframe was split equally between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. 

For the second part of this assignment (Vacation) I narrowed down the selection of cities based on comfortable climate parameters including max and min temperatures, low levels of 
wind and cloudiness to find vacation locations. I then found the nearest hotel to each city if there was a hotel within 5000 meters and plotted these locations on a humidity heatmap.

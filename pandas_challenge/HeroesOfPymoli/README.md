I completed the Heroes of Pymoli challenge which used the file purchase_data.csv to analyze the purchasing data of in game purchases for the fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. 

In order to perform the analysis I used the groupby function to collect data by gender, age. item type and name and player. I used binning and pd.cut to look at age and purchasing statistics. 

The mean, count, sum, and nunique functions were used along with mapping to format the output of several data frames.
